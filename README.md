# Planted.

A tool to track growing things. Lay out your garden or vineyard, saving data about each plant. You can then come back
and continue to enter updates about each plant as it grows. Over time, you should be able to track relative performance
and hopefully trace it back to some source based on the historical data you've accumulated. Unless the deer eat your
stuff. Then there's no mystery to solve. Damn deer.
